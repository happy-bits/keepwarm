Create a commit message based on the code changes in this format:

`[feat/fix/style/refactor/doc]: [Description in English, one sentence, max 100 characters, first letter should be capitalized, use present tense]`

Example:

`fix: Display date as Stockholm timezone`

If the code changes fit as a commit, write:

`✅ Suitable as a commit`

Otherwise write:

`⚠️ Recommend splitting into multiple commits`, give a motivation, and suggest commit messages for each part.

Do not commit; the user will do that.
